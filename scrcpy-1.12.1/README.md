# scrcpy (v1.12)

This application provides display and control of Android devices connected on
USB (or [over TCP/IP][article-tcpip]). It does not require any _root_ access.
It works on _GNU/Linux_, _Windows_ and _macOS_.

![screenshot](assets/screenshot-debian-600.jpg)

It focuses on:

 - **lightness** (native, displays only the device screen)
 - **performance** (30~60fps)
 - **quality** (1920×1080 or above)
 - **low latency** ([35~70ms][lowlatency])
 - **low startup time** (~1 second to display the first image)
 - **non-intrusiveness** (nothing is left installed on the device)

[lowlatency]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/pull/646


## Requirements

The Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).

Make sure you [enabled adb debugging][enable-adb] on your device(s).

[enable-adb]: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#Enabling

On some devices, you also need to enable [an additional option][control] to
control it using keyboard and mouse.

## Get the app


### Linux

On Linux, you typically need to [build the app manually][BUILD]. Don't worry,
it's not that hard.

A [Snap] package is available: [`scrcpy`][snap-link].

[snap-link]: https://snapstats.org/snaps/scrcpy

[snap]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(package_manager)

For Arch Linux, an [AUR] package is available: [`scrcpy`][aur-link].

[AUR]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository
[aur-link]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/scrcpy/

For Gentoo, an [Ebuild] is available: [`scrcpy/`][ebuild-link].

### Windows

For Windows, for simplicity, prebuilt archives with all the dependencies
(including `adb`) are available:

 - [`scrcpy-win32-v1.12.zip`][direct-win32]  
   _(SHA-256: b2c8c4a3899c037cf448a2102906775114826ba646ce1b847826925103fa801d)_
 - [`scrcpy-win64-v1.12.zip`][direct-win64]  
   _(SHA-256: 7d47983b426f7287de0230b88975dc17c1d9c343fa61a93ff2af78b6e9ef5c8c)_

[direct-win32]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases/download/v1.12/scrcpy-win32-v1.12.zip
[direct-win64]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases/download/v1.12/scrcpy-win64-v1.12.zip

You can also [build the app manually][BUILD].


### macOS

The application is available in [Homebrew]. Just install it:

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/

```bash
brew install scrcpy
```

You need `adb`, accessible from your `PATH`. If you don't have it yet:

```bash
brew cask install android-platform-tools
```

You can also [build the app manually][BUILD].


## Run

Plug an Android device, and execute:

```bash
scrcpy
```

It accepts command-line arguments, listed by:

```bash
scrcpy --help
```

## Features

### Capture configuration

#### Reduce size

Sometimes, it is useful to mirror an Android device at a lower definition to
increase performance.

To limit both the width and height to some value (e.g. 1024):

```bash
scrcpy --max-size 1024
scrcpy -m 1024  # short version
```

The other dimension is computed to that the device aspect ratio is preserved.
That way, a device in 1920×1080 will be mirrored at 1024×576.


#### Change bit-rate

The default bit-rate is 8 Mbps. To change the video bitrate (e.g. to 2 Mbps):

```bash
scrcpy --bit-rate 2M
scrcpy -b 2M  # short version
```

#### Limit frame rate

On devices with Android >= 10, the capture frame rate can be limited:

```bash
scrcpy --max-fps 15
```

#### Crop

The device screen may be cropped to mirror only part of the screen.

This is useful for example to mirror only one eye of the Oculus Go:

```bash
scrcpy --crop 1224:1440:0:0   # 1224x1440 at offset (0,0)
```

If `--max-size` is also specified, resizing is applied after cropping.


### Recording

It is possible to record the screen while mirroring:

```bash
scrcpy --record file.mp4
scrcpy -r file.mkv
```

To disable mirroring while recording:

```bash
scrcpy --no-display --record file.mp4
scrcpy -Nr file.mkv
# interrupt recording with Ctrl+C
# Ctrl+C does not terminate properly on Windows, so disconnect the device
```

"Skipped frames" are recorded, even if they are not displayed in real time (for
performance reasons). Frames are _timestamped_ on the device, so [packet delay
variation] does not impact the recorded file.

[packet delay variation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_delay_variation


### Connection

#### Wireless

_Scrcpy_ uses `adb` to communicate with the device, and `adb` can [connect] to a
device over TCP/IP:

1. Connect the device to the same Wi-Fi as your computer.
2. Get your device IP address (in Settings → About phone → Status).
3. Enable adb over TCP/IP on your device: `adb tcpip 5555`.
4. Unplug your device.
5. Connect to your device: `adb connect DEVICE_IP:5555` _(replace `DEVICE_IP`)_.
6. Run `scrcpy` as usual.

It may be useful to decrease the bit-rate and the definition:

```bash
scrcpy --bit-rate 2M --max-size 800
scrcpy -b2M -m800  # short version
```

[connect]: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#wireless


#### Multi-devices

If several devices are listed in `adb devices`, you must specify the _serial_:

```bash
scrcpy --serial 0123456789abcdef
scrcpy -s 0123456789abcdef  # short version
```

You can start several instances of _scrcpy_ for several devices.

#### SSH tunnel

To connect to a remote device, it is possible to connect a local `adb` client to
a remote `adb` server (provided they use the same version of the _adb_
protocol):

```bash
adb kill-server    # kill the local adb server on 5037
ssh -CN -L5037:localhost:5037 -R27183:localhost:27183 your_remote_computer
# keep this open
```

From another terminal:

```bash
scrcpy
```

Like for wireless connections, it may be useful to reduce quality:

```
scrcpy -b2M -m800 --max-fps 15
```

### Window configuration

#### Title

By default, the window title is the device model. It can be changed:

```bash
scrcpy --window-title 'My device'
```

#### Position and size

The initial window position and size may be specified:

```bash
scrcpy --window-x 100 --window-y 100 --window-width 800 --window-height 600
```

#### Borderless

To disable window decorations:

```bash
scrcpy --window-borderless
```

#### Always on top

To keep the scrcpy window always on top:

```bash
scrcpy --always-on-top
```

#### Fullscreen

The app may be started directly in fullscreen:

```bash
scrcpy --fullscreen
scrcpy -f  # short version
```

Fullscreen can then be toggled dynamically with `Ctrl`+`f`.


### Other mirroring options

#### Read-only

To disable controls (everything which can interact with the device: input keys,
mouse events, drag&drop files):

```bash
scrcpy --no-control
scrcpy -n
```

#### Turn screen off

It is possible to turn the device screen off while mirroring on start with a
command-line option:

```bash
scrcpy --turn-screen-off
scrcpy -S
```

Or by pressing `Ctrl`+`o` at any time.

To turn it back on, press `POWER` (or `Ctrl`+`p`).

#### Render expired frames

By default, to minimize latency, _scrcpy_ always renders the last decoded frame
available, and drops any previous one.

To force the rendering of all frames (at a cost of a possible increased
latency), use:

```bash
scrcpy --render-expired-frames
```

#### Show touches

For presentations, it may be useful to show physical touches (on the physical
device).

Android provides this feature in _Developers options_.

_Scrcpy_ provides an option to enable this feature on start and disable on exit:

```bash
scrcpy --show-touches
scrcpy -t
```

Note that it only shows _physical_ touches (with the finger on the device).


### Input control

#### Rotate device screen

Press `Ctrl`+`r` to switch between portrait and landscape modes.

Note that it rotates only if the application in foreground supports the
requested orientation.

#### Copy-paste

It is possible to synchronize clipboards between the computer and the device, in
both directions:

 - `Ctrl`+`c` copies the device clipboard to the computer clipboard;
 - `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`v` copies the computer clipboard to the device clipboard;
 - `Ctrl`+`v` _pastes_ the computer clipboard as a sequence of text events (but
   breaks non-ASCII characters).

#### Text injection preference

There are two kinds of [events][textevents] generated when typing text:
 - _key events_, signaling that a key is pressed or released;
 - _text events_, signaling that a text has been entered.

By default, letters are injected using key events, so that the keyboard behaves
as expected in games (typically for WASD keys).

But this may [cause issues][prefertext]. If you encounter such a problem, you
can avoid it by:

```bash
scrcpy --prefer-text
```

(but this will break keyboard behavior in games)

[textevents]: https://blog.rom1v.com/2018/03/introducing-scrcpy/#handle-text-input
[prefertext]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/650#issuecomment-512945343


### File drop

#### Install APK

To install an APK, drag & drop an APK file (ending with `.apk`) to the _scrcpy_
window.

There is no visual feedback, a log is printed to the console.


#### Push file to device

To push a file to `/sdcard/` on the device, drag & drop a (non-APK) file to the
_scrcpy_ window.

There is no visual feedback, a log is printed to the console.

The target directory can be changed on start:

```bash
scrcpy --push-target /sdcard/foo/bar/
```


### Audio forwarding

Audio is not forwarded by _scrcpy_. Use [USBaudio] (Linux-only).

Also see [issue #14].

## Custom paths

To use a specific _adb_ binary, configure its path in the environment variable
`ADB`:

    ADB=/path/to/adb scrcpy

To override the path of the `scrcpy-server` file, configure its path in
`SCRCPY_SERVER_PATH`.

## Why _scrcpy_?

A colleague challenged me to find a name as unpronounceable as [gnirehtet].

[`strcpy`] copies a **str**ing; `scrcpy` copies a **scr**een.
