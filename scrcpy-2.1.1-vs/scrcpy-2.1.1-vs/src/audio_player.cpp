/**
 * Real-time audio player with configurable latency
 *
 * As input, the player regularly receives AVFrames of decoded audio samples.
 * As output, an SDL callback regularly requests audio samples to be played.
 * In the middle, an audio buffer stores the samples produced but not consumed
 * yet.
 *
 * The goal of the player is to feed the audio output with a latency as low as
 * possible while avoiding buffer underrun (i.e. not being able to provide
 * samples when requested).
 *
 * The player aims to feed the audio output with as little latency as possible
 * while avoiding buffer underrun. To achieve this, it attempts to maintain the
 * average buffering (the number of samples present in the buffer) around a
 * target value. If this target buffering is too low, then buffer underrun will
 * occur frequently. If it is too high, then latency will become unacceptable.
 * This target value is configured using the scrcpy option --audio-buffer.
 *
 * The player cannot adjust the sample input rate (it receives samples produced
 * in real-time) or the sample output rate (it must provide samples as
 * requested by the audio output callback). Therefore, it may only apply
 * compensation by resampling (converting _m_ input samples to _n_ output
 * samples).
 *
 * The compensation itself is applied by libswresample (FFmpeg). It is
 * configured using swr_set_compensation(). An important work for the player
 * is to estimate the compensation value regularly and apply it.
 *
 * The estimated buffering level is the result of averaging the "natural"
 * buffering (samples are produced and consumed by blocks, so it must be
 * smoothed), and making instant adjustments resulting of its own actions
 * (explicit compensation and silence insertion on underflow), which are not
 * smoothed.
 *
 * Buffer underflow events can occur when packets arrive too late. In that case,
 * the player inserts silence. Once the packets finally arrive (late), one
 * strategy could be to drop the samples that were replaced by silence, in
 * order to keep a minimal latency. However, dropping samples in case of buffer
 * underflow is inadvisable, as it would temporarily increase the underflow
 * even more and cause very noticeable audio glitches.
 *
 * Therefore, the player doesn't drop any sample on underflow. The compensation
 * mechanism will absorb the delay introduced by the inserted silence.
